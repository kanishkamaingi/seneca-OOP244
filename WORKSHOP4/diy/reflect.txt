The workshop about the guitar and guitar strings helped me understand the key concepts 
of object oriented programming. In this workshop, we had to create two objects namely 
Guitar and GuitarStr in which we had to make private and public member variables as well
as function. Declaring each variable under proper namespaces and then accessing them 
in proper ways helped me strengthen the concepts of encapsulation. Further, the creation 
of constructor and destructor helped me how to allocate and deallocate the memory. I did 
face some errors in case of memory deallocation which were visible in the output, and 
having to fix these errors made me dig deeper into the concepts. Also, I learned the 
importance of memory management to avoid any kind of memory leaks. I faced some issues 
in this case as matrix showed some memory leaks at first but I managed to solve these 
by deallocating memory at proper places. Overall, the workshop helped me understand OOP 
principles better and gave me important skills for building reliable C++ software systems.
