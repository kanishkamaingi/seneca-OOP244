In the Room Reservation System Workshop, I learned how to design a code with 
modular programming including classes, structs and dynamic memory allocation 
and deallocation. It was pretty interesting working with classes and structs 
at the same time. The workshop helped me understand the polymorphism, data 
encapsulation, abstraction and polymorphism convcepts practically. Also, It
was important to learn the constructor and destructor concepts to manage the
room and guest information correctly. One notable error i encountered was during 
dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. I was facing these issues again
and again especially when deallocating memory to avoid memory leaks. Correcting
them required a proper understanding of all the concepts which made my
understanding of the OOP concepts strong and improved my problem-solving
skills.To fix these memory leaks, I needed to ensure that all dynamically 
allocated memory is properly deallocated before the program exits. This not 
only helped me improve my programming skills but also helped me understand the 
importance of good programming practices.
